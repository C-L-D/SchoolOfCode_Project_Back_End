    description: `Gartic.io is very easy to play but it is very difficult to be the # 1. 
      Basic rules for the game are detailed: Each player has a turn, in which they must draw the object given and facilitate others to guess the right word.
      Other players put the answers in the “answers” box, where the right answer is identified upon submission, and the points are automatically added to the score of the player.
      A player can also guess on an object more than once in Gartic.io.
      The current drawering player can enable a “Hint”. In the hint some letters in the word are given to the guessing players. The hint feature helps players greatly in guessing the right word.
      The players can also skip their turn if they do not want to draw.
      Players are able to chat whilst playing in the chat box.`,

        Use an online Scattergories list generator, like the one at Swellgarfo.com. The host can share their screen. 
        Add or remove categories before you start playing, if desired. There’s a “make child-friendly” option if you have younger players. 
        The list generator also selects a letter at random; tap on “re-roll” for a new letter.
        Swellgarfo.com has a built-in timer function. The default setting is 20 seconds per round and can be changed.
        When you’re ready to start the first round, click “play”. The timer starts automatically.
        When you click “reset” or “restart”  a new letter and a new set of categories for the next round will be generated. 
        If you want to keep the same categories, click on “re-roll” for a new letter. You will need to use an external timer.`,
